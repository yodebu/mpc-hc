* Subtitle renderer: Better compatibility with ASS/SSA subtitle files that are slightly violating the specs
* Rename "Display Stats" and "Reset Display Stats" features to "OSD: Display Renderer Statistics" and
  "OSD: Reset Renderer Statistics" so that their meaning is clearer in the "Keys" option panel. Also
  rename "Display Stats" to "Display Statistics" in the "Renderer Settings" menu
* Ticket #5294, Use internal LAV Splitter for demuxing WTV files
* Tickets #5336/5380, Replace the minidump creation by Doctor Dump, a more advanced crash reporter.
  The new crash reporter is able to send the report automatically after the user's approval and can
  warn the user if the problem has already been fixed in a newer version. It should also be generally
  more reliable than the old method
* Ticket #5416, Rename "Remaining Time" feature to "Display Current Time" in the "Renderer Settings" menu
